# Feature - Dashboard - UI Schema

This module contains the screen where you view health care data. The retrieving of the health 
care data is not done here, it only shows health care data based on `MgoResource`. This 
`MgoResource` is mapped to a `HealthUiSchema`, which is the model that can directly display 
readable health care data.

## Highlighted

- **UiSchemaScreen**: Use to show the screen that displays health care data base on a `MgoResource`.
